	<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
	<p> I believe some aspects of IT should be taught at school exactly the same as languages and mathematics. Having a basic understanding of coding for example should be standard.</p>
<p>I recently found some old homework from grade three. The teacher had asked what my favourite subject was. I wrote down "IT". We had one computer for the whole school and we had just learned how to save files. Super high tech!</p>
<p>I am employed by a company that is in the business of selling software to our clients. I have some dealings with the developers and if I had a greater understanding of what they do and how they do it, I believe the results of our collaboration would be hugely improved.</p> 
<p>RMIT is the only university in Australia that offers a Bachelor degree majoring in Supply Chain Management that can be studied fully online. </p>
<p>Global supply chains rely on latest technologies to improve efficiencies. Distributed ledger technology is tipped to fundamentally transform the space. Smart contracts and immutable transactions in blockchains are the focus of many pilot programs headed by giants such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/au-en/blockchain"target="_blank">IBM</a>, <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/resources/publications/walmart-case-study"target="_blank">Walmart</a> and <a href="https://home.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/co/pdf/2018/09/kpmg-realizing-blockchains-potential.pdf"target="_blank">KPMG</a>. I believe RMIT is on the forefront of integrating the use of latest applications to the study of supply chain management. </p>
<p>During my studies, I expect to gain a much greater understanding of the world around me. I will be positioned to do well in my career.</p>
<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<p>If I were to pursue a career in IT, my ideal job would be Digital Business Analyst. Below is a link to a job advertisement:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39248024?searchrequesttoken=86d62af6-9d61-44a7-bf8d-40d7c04ac54f&type=standard"target="blank"> Digital Business Analyst </a></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/s5hh0wI.jpg"></p>
<p>The job is appealing because it requires the suitable person to not only have a strong technical background and be able to explain business concepts to technical staff but also have the ability to explain difficul concepts to non-technical users. I have always been interested in bridging that gap. I enjoy collaborating with developers and eliciting requirements, and I am also looking to become skilled at project management.</p>
<p>Requirements analysis & the translation of results into technical features and user stories are key parts of this role, alongside confident working knowledge of Drupal (content management system) and search engine optimization. Reporting, monitoring & timely delivery of projects are also KPIs for this role.</p>
<p>I am currently at the very beginning of my journey in IT. I have experience in using technology to drive change management & a central part of my current role is the review of this process and the presentation of findings to clients and vendors. My plan to obtain the skills required for the job of a DBA are: </p>
  <p>1. Finish my Bachelor Degree</p>
  <p>2. Using online resources, learn as much as I can about project management and executing IT strategy</p> 
  <p>3. Review my current role at work and discuss how I could implement the acquisition of new skills in preparation of becoming a DBA;</p> 
  <p>4. Get a mentor that I can reach out to for advice. </p>

<h2>Results of Personality Tests</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I'm an Assertive Campaigner:</li>
<p><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/2f11f474a0d0e"target="_blank"> Myers-Briggs Test</a></p>
<li>I'm a Visual Learner:</li>

<li>My Big 5 are Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness:</li>
  <p><a href="https://bigfive-test.com/result/5d0459abb7fb840062fba6c3"target="blank">Big Five Test</a></ul></p>
  <p>What do the results of the tests mean for me?</p>
  <p>The tests are telling me that I'm an assertive campaigner and I'm a visual learner; that I take the role of a diplomat and my strategy is 'people mastery'. The tests tell me that I'm extroverted but also prone to anxiety. It is true that I often seek to create connections with others and I do so with purpose. There is a mention in the description of my Myers-Briggs personality type that "The Campaigner's self-esteem is dependent on their ability to come up with original solutions". This statement rings true. </p>
  <p>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</p>
	<p>I think these results indicate that I seek to influence people, and have a tendency to take ownership of tasks. Many companies run flattened organisational structures these days and middle management is disappearing. This means that employees on all levels have to show initiative and truly own their roles. Working in teams without dysfunction is important. Perhaps I sometimes let my ego get in the way of good teamwork. I can consciously work towards being more vulnerable to increase the quality of my input in any team.</p>
  <p>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</p>
  <p>According to Patrick Lencioni, teams become dysfunctional when there is an absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability & inattention to results.  Being a 'Campaigner', I must be careful to not make the mistake of not trusting other members of the team. Being diplomatic is helpful, but the team should also be willing to engage in debate and discuss issues that are difficult.

<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<p>This project researches the use of machine learning to enable the automatic categorisation of tens of thousands of products on an online ordering site that is used by restaurants all over Australia. Vendors upload their uncategorised product files to the site, and the company that runs the site is seeking solutions for managing the categorisation of these products. The categorisation of the products is important as it will assist the chefs and restaurant managers to find items that are relevant to their purchasing patterns. In essence, the idea is very similar to the categorisation of products on an e-commerce site and this project is looking to replicate the methods used by online retailers.</p>
<p>The site in question already categorises these products but the categorisation is fully managed by humans. This makes the process slow, leaving thousands of products uncategorised for months, and there is also a risk of the personnel not following the same conventions for categorisation, leading to narrow hierarchies and inconsistent search results. Even though e-commerce has been automating categorisation for years, it is not standard practise in B2B ordering platforms for hospitality supplies. A likely solution lies within the use of support vector machines. </p>
<p>Support vector machines (SVMs) are supervised learning models. Their learning algorithms analyse data that can be used for classification. Machine Learning is used to tag products to enable sites to sort items into right categories & SVM is a popular algorithm for this purpose. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can understand the nuances of products & classify millions of products based on training data (Davis 2017). </p> 
<p>This scenario describes how a 2-class linear SVM can be used as a model that gives a 'yes' or a 'no' answer to a question about a certain product.</p>
<p> The AI tool would run in a supervised learning environment. It will assist in flattening deep hierarchical category structures that are too rigid to work with. Currently, a new class can exponentially increase the number of final categories. The system administrators would add training data to categories such as "Meat", "Seafood" & "Dairy". This means that a product called "Eye Fillet YG Grass Fed PC 250g Southern Prime" equals meat, beef and portion cut and will never equal salmon. </p>
<p> According to Davis (2017), these data relationships would be linked, and the training data will be reused; this way, positive training examples for meat can be used as negative training examples for seafood. In other words, adding training data to the meat category will improve the dairy category via linked negative data. The positive training data for any child node is always used as positive training data for its parent; eye fillet will always equal meat. </p>
<p>The issue is the reliability of data from the vendors; for example, butchers use many words for the same cut of beef - tenderloin vs eye fillet vs TDR - these are all the same thing. Abbreviations are commonly used and there is no industry-wide standard for naming conventions. In addition, the same item codes are interchangeably used for items that are of different specification when out-of-stocks occur. These issues strengthen the case for the use of SVMs over hiring people to sort and categorise these files.</p>
<p>If this model could be rolled out to facilitate the automation of product categarisation loaded into the platform, not only would it save thousands of man-hours but the model can also be scaled with ease to keep competitors at bay. There is potential that the use of machine learning in B2B hospitality platforms will become standard, but it will not happen until one of the companies takes the lead and starts driving innovation & investment in this space. </p>
<p>Demand for this type of service is high as there are thousands of chefs and restaurant owners all over Australia seeking to order online more efficiently. Suggested alternative products and highlighted savings is something the industry can currently only dream of. Often, many chefs in their early years of training lack in product knowledge and suggested ordering and product showcase as well as seasonal specials could have the potential to speed up their learning curve. It goes without saying that a site that boasts these features would make it the ordering site of choice to many restaurants.</p>
<p>The designing, building and testing of this model could take years even with significant resources allocated. The company that decides to implement machine learning to their platform would need to hire a project manager, a team of developers and a dedicated product expert or a CTO. Some of these roles can be outsourced. Even then, an internal member of staff in charge of the delivery of this project would dedicate a large portion of their year to map out and specify the requirements and communicate these to the project team. A good idea would be to hire the services of a consultant who has previously overseen the application of machine learning algorithms in software development. This person can also advice on the preferred background and skills of the chosen development team & project managers.</p>
<p>There is also a possibility to apply for government grants and make use of the tax benefits from research & development. A team that is knowledgeable in machine learning will not come cheap, and even if the investment is likely to bring returns within a year of being deployed in terms of savings in staffing costs and attracting new clients, it is nonetheless a big risk for the company. Should they wish to not apply for outside funding, these grants and tax breaks are a good way to boost cash flow.</p>
